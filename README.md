# GG Faunalytics Coding Tasks

This repository contains a version of the analysis workflow from the Faunalytics project *International Study of Strategies and Needs*, reproduced here for reference and portfolio purposes.

## About the Project

The original study explored strategic priorities and capacity needs across animal advocacy organisations in Asia. It involved extensive data cleaning, descriptive and inferential analysis, and cluster modelling.

## My Role

I led much of the data analysis process, including:
- Cleaning and recoding survey data in R
- Running regression and cluster analyses
- Producing data visualisations for cross-country comparisons
- Managing version control and project documentation

## Attribution

This project was supervised by [Andrea Polanco](https://github.com/andrea-polanco), and was a collaborative effort under Faunalytics and Good Growth.

This version is intended to document my contributions and learning from the project. Please refer to the [original Faunalytics repository](https://github.com/Faunalytics/International-Study-Of-Strategies-And-Needs) for the official project and broader context.
