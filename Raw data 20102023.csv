Project Title: Understanding Global Approaches to Farmed Animal Advocacy



You are invited to take part in this research project because you are involved with a farmed animal/vegan/vegetarian advocacy group or organisation. Your participation in this study is voluntary, and a decision not to participate will not be used against you in any way.



Study Purpose 



We invite you to take part in a study seeking to understand the selection of advocacy approaches chosen by farmed animal protection groups across the world. 



Study Procedure 



If you agree to take part in this survey, we will ask you to answer some questions on your current approaches to animal advocacy, your interest in pursuing other approaches, challenges you may experience, and the kind of support that you would value. Responses to all questions are required. The survey is estimated to take about 5-10 minutes total.



Risks, Inconveniences, and Possible Benefits 



We do not anticipate any risks or benefits to participating in this study.



Incentives 



Upon completion of the survey, you will have the option to be entered in a lottery draw for a USD $100 Amazon gift card (one per 50 respondents), or a donation to an animal charity of your choice, as an incentive for participating in this study. To enter, you are not required to complete this survey. You can review the full sweepstakes rules here.



Withdrawing from the Study 



If you provide your email address and want to withdraw your consent during the course of the study, all information collected from you before your withdrawal may still be used, unless you request that it be removed from the study data. After the study, you may request that your data be removed from the study and deleted by notice given to the primary investigator within 7 days after your completion. Ensure that you provide the email address you used for the study.



If you choose not to provide an email address and would like to withdraw your consent during the course of the study, we will be unable to identify and remove any data you provided before withdrawal.



Confidentiality and Data Retention 



We will remove all identifying information (organisation name, organisation size, organisation budget, individual job role, individual email address and any identifying information in the open-ended answers) from the study data as soon as possible after all data collection is complete. After the study is completed and identifying information is removed, the data from the study will be made Open Access (publicly available free of charge) so that other researchers can use it.

This research project was developed under the guidelines of Faunalytics’ Research Ethics and Data Handling Policy. If you have any questions or concerns relating to your participation, please contact the primary investigator, Dr. Andrea Polanco at andrea@faunalytics.org.
